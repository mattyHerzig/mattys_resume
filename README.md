## Some Changes:
- Miscellaneous
  - Created symbols for the linked websites, using the fontawesome5 package. Also, removed the lines between them so it'd look better
  - Created a "Last Updated" section in the top right, using the xcolor package
- Skills
  - Renamed "Technical Skills" to just "Skills", as I feel like the "Technical" is implied as I've seen it done before
  - Moved the Skills section to just below Education, as it was supposedly recommended by a Google recruiter (on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mzrt2s/comment/gw37pzx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Reddit comment)
  - (I commented out the frameworks and libraries as I personally did not have experience with a significant amount of them at the time of making this to constitute a section for them individually, so it was better left out for space)
  - Used \LaTeX command to show off LaTeX skills.
- Education
  - Used a smaller text font size for a place to put a possible dual enrollment next to the high school
  - Utilized the Education fields differently, e.g. for my GPA rather than location
  - Created a sub-section for Relevant Coursework in the Education section. This is especially useful for undergrads who don't have enough experience or projects to fill up the resume otherwise, and it's expected to list your courses as seen [here](https://pittcs.wiki/career/resume/) ("As a college student [in particular] expect [the Education] section to be pretty comprehensive")
- Projects
  - Made the font smaller for the things used to make the project
  - Changed "Developer Tools" to just "Tools", as I feel like the "Developer" is implied as I've seen it done before
- Experience
  - Moved to the bottom, as I feel like students shouldn't have that impressive, or comprehensive, of an experience section at this point, so I'd rather prioritize the projects. Otherwise, you can always move it back
  - I'm using a more concise Experience section than Jake did, because I feel like it'd be better for a student to have the ability to list more things. Also, I utilized formatting similar to how you'd list the things you used on a Project so that you're able to list your role in the experience, such as "Member, Manager" for a club.

All in all, if you're planning on using it, don't forget you can always move things around, mess with the spacing e.g. with \vspace{}, etc.
  
## Additional Resume Resources:
- Check out Pitt CS's invaluable resume guide [here](https://pittcs.wiki/career/resume/). This is very useful, and here are my main take aways:
  - You should shorten course names e.g. Analytic Geometry & Calculus III -> Calculus III
  - Name the file "FirstName LastName Resume.pdf"
  - Make the file .pdf, not .docx
- Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/)
  - Check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8narz/comment/faeq8s6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Reddit comment, my take away was to make my resume 1 page long
- The BEST thing you can do is look at a bunch of other resumes, preferably from those in your desired profession. See what you like, see what you don't, and change yours accordingly
